While some people may have no qualms leaving their comfortable life to go way out of their comfort zone, most people will need time to come to grips with this change in plans. Not all characters will go willingly, either. Think of how John Wick was brought out of retirement by the desire for revenge.

        'Most of the stepping stones so far have been pretty self-explanatory, however, this one is often up to interpretation. It doesn’t have to be a woman or a goddess or even be a meeting. All that happens is the hero has bestowed a gift that helps them on their journey. In older stories like The Epic of Gilgamesh and The Odyssey, this was the moment where Ishtar (although also the Temptress) or Athena gift the hero with a special ability or tool. \nWhile it’s not used so literally in stories now, it is still a moment where the hero is granted a reward for their hard work. This is where they have gained some sort of fame or notoriety and from that, they are granted access to something that they couldn’t have before their current character development.',
        'Most of the titles that deal with a specific character are more like symbols. In this, the hero won’t necessarily be meeting a woman, but they will be tempted. Think of it this way: your hero has undergone a character development in a short time and now have to confront what that means. Maybe they are more powerful or less selfish, but they’re only halfway. \nWe’re all human and we know how difficult it is to change. This could be where your protagonist struggles at the top of the hill of their development. This is when they’ve burned out of their momentum and must decide whether to give in to their fatigue and roll all the way back down or push their limits and make it to a point where they know they can move forward. Not all make it over that hill.',

Since the father is symbolically the figure who controls the power of life and death or a tight grip over the protagonist’s life. Everything the character has done has led up to this confrontation with themselves (abyss) or an external force (father).',

This may also become a lull into vulnerability as the danger is not over yet.',

This could be nurturing from wounds or rebuilding their life that was destroyed as a catalyst to their leaving it. It is always good to note that your protagonist doesn’t have to go through all of these steps alone. Sometimes part of character development is letting others in and working as a team.',
        'This marks the end of the adventure. The story is done. While the character has wisdom from the events and may have made allies along the way, the conflict has been resolved. The tricky part is whether the character decides to retain this wisdom and continue to practice it and maintain their character development, or whether they are tempted back into old habits. Characters aren’t perfect.',
        'With this wisdom, characters now have a new perspective of the world around them than they did before the journey. They can share this knowledge and create a better world or keep it to themselves and make their lives better. Maybe this knowledge is too dangerous to pass on to others who didn’t go through the process your protagonist did, but they can use it to keep those who are ignorant safe.',
        'Having flown so close to the sun, your protagonist now has an appreciation for some simple things. They may know better, but approach life with more excitement and curiosity than before. Perhaps they lost a friend along the way and have learned to appreciate others more.
